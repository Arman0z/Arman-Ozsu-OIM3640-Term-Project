# PROPOSAL:

### 1. The Big Idea
I will be analyzing NBA data and plan on creating a program capable of producting advanced NBA Team or Player statistical reports for ANY specified time range.

The idea to help out those of us who are less knowledgable about the NBA and could use a platform to inform us on any team or player.

I will explore API and dictionary functionalities and accomplish at least a minimal viable product of a small scale text report generator for simple NBA data based on user inputs.
My stretch goal would be to create a very detailed statistical report using data analytics libraries such as NumPy or Pandas, and customize it based on several inputted parameters and potentially exported to a website or user inbox of sorts.
**For example:** *Given the current NBA schedule, a user can opt to be emailed stastical fun facts about their favorite team, the opposing team, and the history of the 2 teams each game day.*

### 2. Learning Objectives
I hope to refine my knowledge of APIs, Dictionaries, and potentially learn about data analytics libraries or a new library or functionality that would allow me to export my findings directly to users.

APIs & Dictionaries have proven incredibly challenging for me so I believe this project will prove instramental in my learning Python basics.
***
### 3. Implementation Plan
I will begin by selecting a reliable NBA data API to draw my data from. I will then organize the data into a format that can be easily worked with and called upon (potentially experiment with data analyics libraries: NumPy, Pandas, etc...)

I will finally create multiple muttable report templates that can be tailored to user preferences and experiment with exporting options (potentially email or landing webpages)
***
### 4. Project Schedule
** Weeks 1-2 Gathing & Organizing the Data: ** Find a reliable NBA data API. Get it up and running and begin sorting through and organizing data.
** Weeks 3-4 Automate & Customize Reporting/Output: ** Create report templates and research exporting options. At the very least: build a program that can product the reports in python.
** Weeks 5-6 Expand Reporting Potential: ** Finalize the chosen exporting solution and begin data analytics phase. Learn as much as possible and configure graphs, cool statistics, and other key elements of the report.

### 5. Collaboration Plan
I am working solo, I will set reminders on my phone to keep me accountable. I will likely perform code review with one of my peers to improve each others code and help each other come up with ideas.
***
### 6. Risks and Limitations
The most significant threat is the data source (NBA API). I do not believe there is an *Official* NBA API currently available so I will have to trust the work of a complete stranger.
***
### 7. Additional Course Content
Data Analytics Libraries, Dictionaries, APIs, and Web Development.
There are multiple roads I can take to accomplish this project but these are a few topics we've discussed that will likely prove pivital to the success of my project.
